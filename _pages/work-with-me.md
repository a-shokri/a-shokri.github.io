I’m recruiting students who are excited about building the next generation of approaches and tools for **automating software development** and improving **code reliability and security**. My group works on topics such as:

- Code translation and synthesis  
- Bug detection and program analysis  
- Software quality and security assurance

**Please note:** All applications are handled centrally through the [UH CS Graduate Admissions page](https://uh.edu/nsm/computer-science/graduate/admissions/). I cannot admit students directly.

## Ph.D. Applicants

If you're **already admitted** to the Ph.D. program and interested in the areas above, I'd like to hear from you. Please email me using the subject line:  
[Admitted PhD Student] Fall 2025 (or the relevant semester).

If you're **planning to apply** to the Ph.D. program at the [UH Department of Computer Science](https://uh.edu/nsm/computer-science/) and:

- Have a strong programming background (e.g., app/system development, analysis tools, static analysis)  
- Have demonstrated research experience through papers or other solid evidences  
- Are clearly aligned with the research directions of my group  

I encourage you to apply and **mention my name in your Statement of Purpose** so your application is flagged for review. You **do not need to email me directly**. Instead, please complete the [Ph.D. Interest Form](https://forms.gle/DPvfmVDgoQfjhaoW9). I’ll follow up if needed during the admission process.

## UH M.S. Students

If you're a current Master’s student in the CS department at UH and are interested in working with me on a research project, thesis, or capstone related to software productivity or quality, please complete the [Master’s Interest Form](https://forms.gle/v8gxsCrfg25MrqD36). Please note that I'm not hiring for an RA roll at this moment, but would be happy to hearing from you if you're looking for an advisor.

## Advisor Assignment at UH

You **do not need to secure a faculty advisor before applying** to UH’s Ph.D. or M.S. programs. Students are first admitted by the department. Research advising typically begins after admission, once mutual interest and fit are established.

Filling out a form or expressing interest is **non-binding** for either side. It simply opens the door for a possible research match.

*Due to the high volume of interest, I'm unable to respond to individual emails. Please fill out the form only, and I’ll reach out if there’s a potential match.*
