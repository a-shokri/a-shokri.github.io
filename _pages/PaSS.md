I’m recruiting students who are excited about building the next generation of approaches and tools for **automating software development** and improving **code quality, reliability, and security**. My group works on topics such as:

- Code translation and synthesis  
- Bug detection and program analysis  
- Software quality and security assurance

**Please note:** All applications are handled centrally through the [UH CS Graduate Admissions page](https://uh.edu/nsm/computer-science/graduate/admissions/). I cannot admit students directly.

## Ph.D. Applicants
I’m not actively hiring a new PhD student right now. That said, if you are a current PhD student and would like to explore a collaborative research project in the areas above, I’d be happy to hear from you.<!– If you’re already admitted to the Ph.D. program and interested in the areas above, I’d like to hear from you. Please email me using the subject line:
[Admitted PhD Student] Fall 2025 (or the relevant semester).

If you’re planning to apply to the Ph.D. program at the UH Department of Computer Science and:

    Have a strong programming background (e.g., app/system development, analysis tools, static analysis)
    Have demonstrated research experience through papers or other solid evidences
    Are clearly aligned with the research directions of my group

I encourage you to apply and mention my name in your Statement of Purpose so your application is flagged for review. You do not need to email me directly. Instead, please complete the Ph.D. Interest Form. I’ll follow up if needed during the admission process. -–>

## UH M.S. Students

If you're a current Master’s student in the CS department at UH and are interested in working with me on a research project, thesis, or capstone related to software productivity or quality, please complete the [Master’s Interest Form](https://forms.gle/v8gxsCrfg25MrqD36). Please note that I'm not hiring for an RA roll at this moment, but would be happy to hearing from you if you're looking for an advisor.

## Advisor Assignment at UH

You **do not need to secure a faculty advisor before applying** to UH’s Ph.D. or M.S. programs. Students are first admitted by the department. Research advising typically begins after admission, once mutual interest and fit are established.

Filling out a form or expressing interest is **non-binding** for either side. It simply opens the door for a possible research match.


*Due to the high volume of interest, I'm unable to respond to individual emails. Please fill out the form only, and I’ll reach out if there’s a potential match.*
